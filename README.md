Microsaccade detection plugin for EEGlab

This is an early build of a plugin for detecting microsaccades from EOG channels in EEG data.
It has been tested on version 11 of eeglab, and on Matlab versions 2009a and 2012b. It currently implements the method seen in Keren, Yuval-Greenberg, & Deouell (2010): Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression, Neuroimage (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057). It requires either the signal processing toolbox or a saccadic spike potential filter (http://hcnl.huji.ac.il/Leon/Lab/tools/filtSRP.m)
